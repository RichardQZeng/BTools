# Canopy Cost Raster

Creates a canopy raster and a cost raster from a CHM input raster. The
output rasters are used for subsequent BERA tools.

## Python Interface

### Method

Canopy Cost Raster provide Python method for calling directly:

``` python
def canopyCost(in_raster,
               out_canopy_raster, out_cost_raster,
               height_thresh=1, search_radius=3,
               max_line_dist=10, canopy_avoidance=0.3,
               cost_exponent=1.5):
```

### Parameters

-   **in_raster**: Input forest line center shapefile which will be
    segmented and attributed.
-   **Canopy Height Model (CHM) Raster**: Input CHM raster file used as
    basis for mapping forest lines and their footprint. This layer
    should be projected in any Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
    coordinate system. The data should be preferably derived from high
    resolution LiDAR or photogrammetry (\>25 pts/mÂ²).
-   **height_thresh**: Height threshold in meters above which CHM pixels
    are considered canopy.
-   **search_radius**: Radius of canopy influence in the cost raster.
    This factor smooths the canopy in the cost raster which helps to
    prevent gaps in sparsely vegetated areas (e.g. wetlands) to be
    incorrectly identified as footprint. A large search radius (\>=5m)
    may cause excessive smoothing of the cost raster which can lead to
    least cost paths ignoring forest-line nuances in sparsely vegetated
    forests. A small radius (\<=1m) may cause the least cost path to cut
    corners through small gaps in sparse vegetation as well as avoid
    small obstacles that should not affect overall line shape.
-   **max_line_dist**: Maximum euclidean distance from canopy. This is a
    second smoothing factor which helps to position the forest line
    shape in the center of the line footprint. An excessively small
    (\<=1m) or large (\>20m) value may cause the center line to be
    positioned close to one of the edges of the footprint.
-   **canopy_avoidance**: Ratio of importance between canopy search
    radius and euclidean distance. A value close to zero (0) prioritizes
    search radius whereas a value close to one (1) prioritizes euclidean
    distance. A small value (\<=0.1) may cause the forest lines to miss
    nuances in sparsely vegetated terrain whereas a big value (\>=0.5)
    may overemphasize turns in complex trails. This factor influences
    final footprint size in a minor way.
-   **cost_exponent**: Affects the cost of vegetated areas in an
    exponential fashion. A low (\<=1) exponent may lead to lines cutting
    through corners, whereas a large (\>=3) exponent may lead to least
    cost paths completely avoiding narrow lines.
-   **out_canopy_raster**: Output raster classified as canopy (1) and
    non-canopy (0).
-   **out_cost_raster**: Output cost raster used in subsequent BERA
    tools for least-cost analysis.
